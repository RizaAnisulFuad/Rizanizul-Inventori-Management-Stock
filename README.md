# Inventory Management Stock

A simple Inventory Management Stock app with MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). Organize and manage your inventory stock so easier.

# Dependencies

- **ExpressJS** :
    - minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It facilitates the development of web applications by providing a simple, unopinionated interface and a variety of powerful features.

- **MongoDB** :
    - popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It falls under the category of non-relational databases and is designed for scalability, flexibility, and performance. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to model and represent complex hierarchical relationships.

- **ReactJS** :
    - commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). Developed and maintained by Facebook, React has gained significant popularity among developers for its efficiency, performance, and simplicity.

- **NodeJS** : 
    - open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to build scalable, server-side, and network applications using JavaScript.

- **Bootstrap** : 
    - free and open-source front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first web projects. It was originally created by developers at Twitter and is now maintained by a community of developers. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and utilities that help developers quickly build consistent and visually appealing web interfaces.

- **Zunstand** : 
    -  simple and lightweight solution for managing state in React components, particularly useful for smaller to medium-sized applications where a full-fledged state management solution like Redux might be overkill.
